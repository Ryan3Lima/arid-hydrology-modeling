title: "Week 1 – Conceptual Models & Arid Hydrology (Arizona Case Study)"
subtitle: "Upper Verde River (HUC8 15060202) — building defensible assumptions from public data"
---

## Week goals

By the end of Week 1, you will be able to:

- Delineate a real basin using **USGS StreamStats** and extract basin characteristics
- Build a **defensible conceptual groundwater model** for an arid/SW basin using proxy evidence
- Identify likely **recharge zones**, **flow directions**, and **discharge zones** (with justification)
- Write a short **assumptions + uncertainty memo** in a consulting style

---

## Case study basin

**Upper Verde River (HUC8: 15060202)** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Why this basin works for learning:
- Arizona-relevant hydroclimate and mixed mountain/basin settings
- Strong groundwater–surface water interactions (springs/baseflow on parts of the Verde)
- Plenty of public context, but still “real-world messy” in terms of uncertainty

---

## Tools you will use this week

- **USGS StreamStats (Arizona application)** for basin delineation + basin characteristics :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- A basemap viewer (web) and/or GIS (optional) for hillshade/geology screenshots
- Your notes (markdown or a dedicated `week-01-notes.md`)

> You do not need to build a numerical model yet. The job skill this week is:
> turning incomplete evidence into explicit, defensible assumptions.

---

## Deliverables (you will publish these to your repo)

Create a folder: `curriculum/week-01-deliverables/`

By the end of the week, commit:

1. `upper-verde_streamstats_report.pdf` (or HTML print) + `upper-verde_basin_boundary.*` if you export it
2. `figure_01_basin_overview.png` (annotated screenshot map with basin outline)
3. `figure_02_conceptual_model_planview.png` (your conceptual diagram)
4. `figure_03_conceptual_model_xsection.png` (your conceptual cross-section)
5. `upper-verde_conceptual-model-memo.md` (1–2 pages)

# Daily plan (2–3 hrs/day)

## Day 1 — Delineate the basin + collect the “minimum defensible dataset”

### 1) Delineate a watershed in StreamStats
Go to the **USGS StreamStats Arizona application** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

Do the following:

- Use the map interface to select a point on the **Upper Verde River network**.
  - Choose a point that makes sense as a “project point” (e.g., upstream of a confluence, near a town crossing, or another recognizable location).
- Run **Delineate** to generate the basin boundary.
- Export:
  - Basin boundary (shapefile/geojson if available), OR at minimum a screenshot with the boundary visible
  - Basin characteristics report (download or print-to-PDF)

**Deliverable:** Save into `curriculum/week-01-deliverables/`:
- `upper-verde_streamstats_report.pdf`
- `figure_01_basin_overview.png` (screenshot of delineated basin + point)

### 2) Extract the “minimum dataset” from StreamStats outputs
From the StreamStats report, capture (copy into notes):
- Drainage area
- Mean basin elevation / relief (if available)
- Slope metrics
- Any climate/precipitation indices StreamStats provides
- Any flow statistics (peak/low flow estimates) if available in AZ StreamStats

> StreamStats provides GIS-derived basin characteristics and flow statistics in many regions; document exactly what it gives you for your point. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 3) Make a 1-paragraph basin description
Write a short description (5–8 sentences) summarizing:
- Basin location / setting
- General hydroclimate (arid SW)
- What StreamStats says about size, elevation, slope
- Why this is a groundwater-relevant basin (hypothesis to test later)

---

## Day 2 — Build a defensible recharge-zone map (no “guessing”)

You will map **recharge likelihood zones** using proxy evidence.

### Inputs (choose at least two)
Use StreamStats + one or more of:
- Hillshade / DEM view (web map or GIS)
- Geologic map screenshot (state or USGS)
- Soils / land cover view (optional)

### How to classify recharge zones (rules you must apply)
Create 3–5 “recharge likelihood” classes and justify them:

**A. Mountain blocks / high elevation zones**
- Hypothesis: higher precip, runoff generation → potential mountain-front recharge (MFR)
- Note uncertainty: fractured bedrock can transmit recharge, but spatially variable

**B. Alluvial fans / basin-fill margins**
- Hypothesis: coarse sediments + focused runoff infiltration → higher recharge potential

**C. Ephemeral channel corridors**
- Hypothesis: focused infiltration during stormflow; losing reaches likely in coarse alluvium

**D. Basin floor fine sediments / high ET zones**
- Hypothesis: generally low diffuse recharge; high evaporative demand

### Deliverable
Create `figure_02_conceptual_model_planview.png`:
- Start with your basin overview (Day 1)
- Add labeled polygons/regions for recharge likelihood classes
- Add 5–10 annotation callouts (“Why this is likely a recharge zone”)

Also create a short table in your notes:

| Recharge zone | Evidence used | Why plausible | Biggest uncertainty |
|---|---|---|---|

---

## Day 3 — Infer groundwater flow directions + discharge zones (with explicit logic)

### 1) Flow directions (what you must do)
Sketch a **potentiometric surface hypothesis** using:

- Topographic gradients as first-order control (mountains → valley)
- Stream corridor as potential discharge zone (baseflow/springs) or losing zone (episodic infiltration)
- Pumping centers (if you can identify municipal/ag regions from public info; if not, note as “unknown”)

You are not claiming truth — you are constructing a **defensible first-pass hypothesis**.

### 2) Discharge zones (identify at least 2 types)
Common arid/SW discharge mechanisms:
- Spring discharge / baseflow to the river
- Pumping (anthropogenic discharge)
- Riparian ET (phreatophytes) where shallow water table exists

### Deliverable
Create `figure_03_conceptual_model_xsection.png`:
- Cross-section from highlands → basin fill → river corridor
- Include:
  - Hydrostratigraphy (bedrock vs basin fill)
  - Water table shape (conceptual)
  - Recharge arrows (by zone)
  - Discharge arrows (river/baseflow, ET, wells)
  - A note identifying “unknowns” (e.g., depth to bedrock, K contrasts)

Write 8–12 bullets answering:
- “If challenged, what evidence supports my flow direction arrows?”

---

## Day 4 — Data constraints + “defensibility audit”

Make a table (this is a consulting staple):

| Unknown / data gap | Why it matters | How it could change conclusions | What proxy you used |
|---|---|---|---|

Examples of typical arid-basin constraints:
- Sparse head observations (few wells)
- Poorly constrained hydraulic conductivity zonation
- Recharge magnitude & timing unknown
- Stream–aquifer interaction unknown (losing vs gaining varies)
- Pumping time series unknown

Then write two lists:

**Most defensible assumptions (5–8)**  
**Most vulnerable assumptions (5–8)**

Finally, write 3 “challenge questions” someone could ask in a review:
- “How do you know recharge is focused there?”
- “Why is that boundary no-flow?”
- “What evidence supports gaining vs losing reaches?”

## Day 5 — Write the conceptual model memo (portfolio piece)

Create `upper-verde_conceptual-model-memo.md`_
