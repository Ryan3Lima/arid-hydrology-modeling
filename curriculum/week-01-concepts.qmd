title: "Week 1 – Conceptual Models & Arid Hydrology"
---

## Objectives

- Understand groundwater flow in arid systems
- Identify dominant recharge mechanisms
- Develop defensible conceptual models under data scarcity

## Key Themes

- Conceptual uncertainty > parameter uncertainty
- Recharge as an inferred quantity
- Basin-scale thinking

## Exercises

1. Sketch a conceptual groundwater model for an arid basin
2. Identify recharge pathways and uncertainties
3. Write a 1–2 page conceptual model memo
