title: "Hydrologic Modeling in Arid Systems"
---

## Purpose

This repository documents a one-month self-directed curriculum focused on
**defensible groundwater and hydrologic modeling in arid and semi-arid systems**,
with an emphasis on:

- Sparse data environments  
- Groundwater-dominated basins  
- Recharge uncertainty  
- Open-source modeling tools  

The goal is not to produce “perfect” models, but to **understand, explain, and
defend modeling assumptions**, consistent with real-world consulting practice.

## Audience

- Early-career hydrologists
- Graduate students
- Practitioners transitioning into modeling-heavy roles

## Tools

- MODFLOW 6
- FloPy
- ModelMuse
- Python / Jupyter
- Quarto

## Structure

The curriculum is organized into four weeks, each combining:
- Conceptual grounding
- Hands-on modeling
- Uncertainty analysis
- Professional communication
